Pony
====

As it is one of the new-comer languages with some of the most interesting ideas, I have decided to learn at least a little of `pony <http://ponylang.org>`_.

This repository, as several of my others, will serve as a place for me to learn the ropes of pony.

See the issue tracker for a todo-list.
